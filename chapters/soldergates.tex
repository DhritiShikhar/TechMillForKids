\section{Optional: Solder Some Gates}

If you have the time and equipment, it can be fun and useful to solder some of the components together to make some of the basic logic gates. Several completed PCBs are already available, so this exercise is optional. % Some of the more advanced gates and whole circuits will also be put on PCBs to make later experiments much less tedious.

\subsection*{Solder An OR Gate}

\bi

\+ Get component list 
\+ Identify each resistor by color bands (see Appendix, Figure \ref{fig:resistorchart})
\+ Read part numbers on the transistors to make sure (need magnifying glass)
%\+ Diodes (including LEDs) and transistors have a specific orientation so be sure to know which way things go
\+ solder resistors first
\+ then solder the N-type transistors 
\+ lastly, solder the headers (note: it may be helpful to use headers with long pins on both sides, to enable both breadboard use and discrete-wiring use, but otherwise solder the headers with the long pins facing \emph{down}).

This project includes a separate {\color{webblue}\href{https://github.com/jessehamner/TechMillForKids/tree/master/soldering}{PDF sub-project}} that teaches basic through-hole soldering, available in the same github directory as this project. Because soldering irons get very hot, adult supervision and safety glasses are required.

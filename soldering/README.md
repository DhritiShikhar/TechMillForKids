# Soldering Tutorial

Originally aimed at undergraduate students with no prior soldering experience, I include this tutorial here because it's a useful component of the overall goals of technical literacy. The kids, optionally, can solder the logic gate PCBs with novice-friendly through-hole components. 

This tutorial, like the others in this repository, can be improved and made more suitable for third and fourth graders. 

Note that the release forms required to let elementary students handle 700-degree F soldering irons might reduce the general appeal of this tutorial for some parents. Ensure that you have adequate stocks of completed logic gates for those kids or those workshops that don't teach soldering, or that have particularly inept solderers.
